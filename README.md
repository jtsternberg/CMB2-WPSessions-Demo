CMB2 WPSessions Demo
====

A WPSessions demo/walk-through for using CMB2 to power your project's fields. This repo is to demonstrate how to get up and running with CMB2 and will be used for my [WPSessions session](http://wpsessions.com/sessions/custom-meta-and-settings-with-cmb2/).

To follow demonstration, [check out the tags](https://github.com/jtsternberg/CMB2-WPSessions-Demo/releases) in order.
