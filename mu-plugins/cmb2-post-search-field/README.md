CMB2 Post Search field
======================

Custom field for CMB2 which adds a post-search dialog for searching/attaching other post IDs

Adds a new field type, `post_search_text` that adds a quick post search dialog for saving post IDs to a text input.

If you're looking for a more general way to attach posts (or other custom post types) with a drag and drop interface, you might consider [CMB2 Attached Posts Field](https://github.com/WebDevStudios/cmb2-attached-posts) instead.
